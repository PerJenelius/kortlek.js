This is a simple plain javascript solution that generates and shuffles a deck of cards. It can be included in other, bigger projects such as card games.
The app uses javascript's native Math.random() function for random numbers, which is good enough for its purposes.

To run:
Download the code and unzip it in a folder on your computer.
Open a browser and navigate to that folder. Open index.html. Done!
